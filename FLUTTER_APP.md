# Lean Flutter - Native Mobile Rebuild

## Philosophy: Steve Jobs Frictionless
Type → Save → Search. Zero chrome, zero friction, zero compromises.

**What we're building**: Native mobile app that feels instant, works offline, respects minimalism. Input always focused. <100ms saves. ASCII aesthetic. Clean, powerful, yours.

**Why Flutter over PWA**:
- Full screen (no browser chrome eating 15%)
- True native keyboard control
- Reliable background sync
- Deep system integration
- Consistent behavior (iOS = Android)
- Professional app experience

**What we're NOT building**:
- App Store presence (just a link to install)
- Multi-user features
- Cloud-first architecture
- Complex animations
- Feature bloat

- Project setup & Supabase SDK: 4-6h
- Core UI (input, entries, save): 12-16h
- Commands system (/search, /today, etc.): 8-10h
- Todo checkboxes & counter: 4-6h
- Time dividers & themes: 6-8h
- Export & stats: 4-6h
- Testing & polish: 8-12h

### LLM Prompt Engineering (Phase 4)
**~15-25 hours** | AI agent
- Context extraction improvement: 8-12h
- Multi-model support (Claude/Gemini/local): 4-6h
- Enrichment UI polish: 3-5h
- Testing & fine-tuning: 4-6h

### Whisper Voice Input (Optional Phase 5)
**~20-30 hours** | Backend agent + Frontend agent
- iOS/Android audio recording: 6-8h
- Whisper API integration: 4-6h
- Edit-before-enrich flow: 6-8h
- Voice button UI: 2-3h

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 0: Branch & Setup [Backend Agent]
- Create `flutter-rebuild` branch
- Install Flutter SDK (verify `flutter doctor`)
- Create Flutter project: `flutter create lean_flutter`
- Add Supabase Flutter SDK to `pubspec.yaml`
- Configure for web + iOS + Android deployment
- Set up folder structure (lib/screens, lib/widgets, lib/services)

### Phase 1: Core Architecture [Backend Agent → Frontend Agent]
**Backend Agent**:
- Supabase service layer (auth, entries CRUD, sync)
- Local SQLite fallback (offline-first with `sqflite`)
- State management (Provider or Riverpod for simplicity)

**Frontend Agent**:
- Main screen: TextField (always focused) + Entry list
- Optimistic UI: instant save + green flash
- Entry widget: ASCII checkboxes (□/☑), tap to toggle
- Character counter, time dividers

### Phase 2: Commands & Features [Frontend Agent]
- Command parser: detect `/search`, `/today`, `/essay`, etc.
- Search & filtering (tags, dates)
- Export modal (markdown download)
- Stats modal (entry counts, streaks)
- Theme switcher (5 minimal themes)
- Keyboard shortcuts (hardware keyboard support)

### Phase 3: Mobile Polish [Design Agent → Frontend Agent]
**Design Agent**: Audit mobile UX, create guidelines for:
- Touch targets (44x44pt minimum)
- Gesture controls (swipe to delete?)
- FAB or bottom bar for commands
- Input handling (mobile keyboard dismiss)

**Frontend Agent**: Implement design specs
- Responsive layouts (narrow screens)
- Platform-specific behaviors (iOS vs Android)
- Smooth animations (hero transitions?)
- Error states & empty states

### Phase 4: LLM Intelligence [AI Agent]
- Improve prompt engineering (better context extraction)
- Multi-model support: Claude API, Gemini, Ollama
- Enrichment badges (⚡ visual indicator)
- Background enrichment queue
- Settings: enable/disable, model selection

### Phase 5: Whisper Voice (Optional) [Backend Agent + Frontend Agent]
**Backend Agent**:
- Whisper API integration (OpenAI or local)
- Audio file handling & transcription
- Error handling (network, permissions)

**Frontend Agent**:
- Voice button UI (hold to record?)
- Audio recording (platform audio capture)
- Edit-then-enrich flow: transcribe → show in input → user edits → save → optionally enrich

---

## Critical Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Speed**: Save in <100ms, UI responds instantly
2. **Offline**: Full functionality without network
3. **Simplicity**: No loading spinners, no complexity
4. **ASCII Aesthetic**: □ ☑ ━━━ minimal characters
5. **Frictionless**: Input focused on launch, Enter = save
6. **Data Ownership**: Export to markdown anytime
7. **No Bloat**: Every feature must justify its existence

---

## Agent Assignment Summary

- **Backend Agent**: Supabase, SQLite, sync, audio/Whisper APIs
- **Frontend Agent**: UI, widgets, screens, keyboard handling
- **Design Agent**: Mobile UX audit, touch targets, gesture design
- **AI Agent**: Prompt engineering, enrichment, multi-model support

---

## Branch Strategy
- Main branch: Current PWA (stable)
- `flutter-rebuild`: New Flutter app (parallel development)
- Deployment: Flutter web hosted separately, mobile as direct install link
- No app stores (sideload or TestFlight/Firebase for testing)

---

## Success Metrics
- [ ] App launches in <1 second
- [ ] Save happens in <100ms
- [ ] Works fully offline
- [ ] Zero crashes in 1-week dogfooding
- [ ] Input always focused on fresh launch
- [ ] LLM enrichment feels magical (not janky)
- [ ] Voice input transcribes accurately, edits before save
- [ ] You feel proud showing this to others

**What's Working**:
- ✅ Supabase client initialized successfully
- ✅ Offline-first: App loads and works WITHOUT authentication
- ✅ Optional cloud sync: User can click "Sign In" to enable sync
- ✅ Email/password auth (matches PWA behavior exactly)
- ✅ Auth button shows: "Sign In" (logged out) or username (logged in)
- ✅ Sync indicator: ○ (offline) or ● (synced)

- ✅ Optimistic UI: Saves to local first, syncs to cloud in background
- ✅ Graceful fallback: App works perfectly without cloud (offline-first!)

**Auth Flow** (Matches PWA):
1. App starts → Shows HomeScreen immediately (no auth required)
2. User can use app fully offline
3. Click "Sign In" button (top-left) → Shows auth modal
4. Sign in/up with email + password → Modal closes automatically on success
5. Background sync activates automatically
6. Button shows username, indicator shows ●

### ✅ Phase 3: Mobile Polish (100% COMPLETE - 2025-10-19)

- [x] Enhanced error states with retry actions

**What Works**:
- ✅ All touch targets meet 48x48pt minimum (iOS/Android standards)
- ✅ Swipe left on entry → Shows delete confirmation
- ✅ FAB appears on mobile (< 600px) with smooth animations
- ✅ Keyboard dismisses automatically when scrolling
- ✅ iOS haptic feedback on save, delete, checkbox toggle
- ✅ Responsive padding (16px on mobile, 20px on desktop)
- ✅ Beautiful empty states with icons and instructions
- ✅ Enhanced error messages with retry buttons
- ✅ Professional mobile-first UX matching iOS/Android standards

**Critical Bug Fix - Todo Filter State** (2025-10-19 - 1 hour):
- [x] **FIXED**: Todo view auto-exit bug - now stays in todo view when marking items done
- [x] **ROOT CAUSE**: Todo counter was counting from filtered list instead of all entries
- [x] **SOLUTION**: Added `openTodoCount` getter to count from `_allEntries` (matches PWA)
- [x] **IMPROVED**: Single state update in `toggleTodo` (no duplicate notifications)
- [x] **ADDED**: Auto-clear filter when last todo is marked done (PWA behavior)
- [x] Files changed:
  - `entry_provider.dart:29-31` - New `openTodoCount` getter
  - `entry_provider.dart:415-478` - Refactored `toggleTodo` method
  - `home_screen.dart:310` - Todo counter uses new getter
- ✅ **VERIFIED**: Flutter now matches PWA behavior exactly:
  - Click todo counter → view todos
  - Mark todo done → item vanishes, counter updates
  - **STAY in todo view** (no auto-exit)
  - Last todo done → auto-return to normal view
