# LEAN INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM - Implementation Specification

## Executive Summary

Build a privacy-first, local intelligence layer for Lean that extracts structured insights from unstructured thoughts. The system learns user patterns without requiring configuration, extracts trackable events conservatively, and surfaces meaningful connections between thoughts, people, and behaviors.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

**Entry Pipeline**
- User types entry → Save to DB instantly (<100ms)
- Trigger async enrichment pipeline
- Display enrichment status (⚡ processing → ✓ complete)
- Store raw entry + enrichments separately

**Intelligence Layers**
1. **Tier 1 (Universal)** - Applied to 100% of entries
2. **Tier 2 (Event)** - Applied when confidence ≥0.85
3. **Tier 3 (Patterns)** - Computed from accumulated data
4. **Tier 4 (Insights)** - Higher-order connections

**Storage Strategy**
- Raw entries: Immutable source of truth
- Enrichments: JSONB fields, versioned
- Patterns: Materialized views, refreshed hourly
- Events: Separate table with entry linkage

## Intelligence Pipeline

### Stage 1: Entry Processing (Synchronous)
1. Save raw entry
2. Return success immediately
3. Queue enrichment job

### Stage 2: Tier 1 Enrichment (Async, <3s)

**Emotion Detection**
- Vocabulary: frustrated, anxious, excited, content, calm, energized, tired, sad, angry, overwhelmed, focused, grateful, contemplative, curious, scattered, accomplished, lonely, bored, neutral
- Method: LLM with fallback to keyword patterns
- Constraints: Single emotion per entry

**Theme Classification**
- Vocabulary: work, personal, health, relationships, finance, creative, tech, learning, leisure, reflection
- Method: LLM with fallback to keyword matching
- Constraints: Maximum 3 themes, ordered by relevance

**People Extraction**
- Method: NER + capitalization patterns + user context
- Enhancement: Track sentiment about person in this entry
- Store: Name + sentiment + context of mention

**Urgency Detection**
- Levels: low, medium, high
- Signals: Time markers, action words, emotional intensity
- Method: Rule-based + LLM validation

**Action Extraction**
- Patterns: "need to", "must", "todo:", "should", "have to"
- Method: Regex + LLM validation
- Output: Array of actionable items

**Question Detection**
- Types: open-ended, yes/no, rhetorical
- Method: Punctuation + sentence structure + LLM
- Track: Question lifecycle (open → answered)

### Stage 3: Tier 2 Event Extraction (Async, <3s)

**✨ NEW: LLM-Based Event Extraction (October 2025)**
- **Single API call** extracts both enrichment AND events
- **Claude AI** understands natural language variations
- **500+ lines of regex removed** - handles infinite variations!

**LLM Confidence Scoring**
- 0.9-1.0: Explicit metrics + past tense ("ran 5km", "had 3 coffees")
- 0.7-0.9: Past activity, no metrics ("went running", "had coffee")
- 0.5-0.7: Ambiguous mention ("coffee break", "gym day")
- 0.0-0.3: Future intent ("will run", "planning to swim")

**Extraction Thresholds**
- Extract: confidence ≥ 0.85
- Shadow (learn but don't save): 0.65-0.85
- Ignore: <0.65

**Event Types**
- exercise (subtypes: squat, run, walk, yoga, swim, bike, weights)
- consumption (subtypes: alcohol, caffeine, food, supplements)
- spend (subtypes: groceries, transport, entertainment, bills)
- sleep (metrics: duration, quality)
- meeting (subtypes: 1:1, team, client, interview)
- health (subtypes: symptom, medication, appointment)

**Examples That Work Now (Failed with Regex)**
- "Coffee #3 already" → consumption.coffee, count:3, confidence:0.95
- "Swam 40 laps in 35 minutes" → exercise.swim, laps:40, duration:35, confidence:1.0
- "Quick gym session" → exercise.gym, confidence:0.70
- "2hr meeting with Sarah" → meeting, duration:120, attendees:['Sarah'], confidence:0.90

### Stage 4: Pattern Detection (Batch, hourly)

**VLP Promotion**
- Trigger: Phrase used 3+ times in 28 days
- Validation: Check for consistency in context
- Auto-promote: If confidence >0.90
- User-promote: Present in UI for confirmation

**Person Relationships**
- Analyze co-occurrence with themes/contexts
- Infer relationship type from interaction patterns
- Calculate average sentiment
- Track interaction frequency

**Temporal Patterns**
- Segment by: hour blocks, day of week
- Calculate: dominant emotions, themes, entry frequency
- Identify: Peak productivity, stress times, reflection periods

**Causal Chains**
- Window: Look for patterns within time windows
- Correlation: Track A→B occurrences
- Threshold: Minimum 3 occurrences for pattern
- Types: stress→coping, activity→mood, trigger→behavior

### Stage 5: Insight Generation (Batch, daily)

**Cross-Pattern Analysis**
- People + emotion correlations
- Time + theme patterns
- Event + outcome chains
- Question → answer paths

**Anomaly Detection**
- Unusual emotion for time period
- Break in established patterns
- New people/contexts appearing
- Urgency spikes

## User Experience

### Entry Flow
1. User types entry
2. Instant save (<100ms)
3. Lightning icon appears (enriching)
4. Check mark appears (2s, then fades)
5. Enrichments silently added to entry

### Command Enhancements

### Pattern Validation UI

**For VLP Detection**
```
💡 Pattern detected: "leg day!" (used 3 times)
Track this as: [Exercise - Leg workout]
[Always track] [Never track] [Ask later]
```

**For Causal Patterns**
```
🔗 Pattern noticed: "stressful meeting" → "whiskey" (within 6 hours)
This happened 4 times in the past month.
[Acknowledge] [Not a pattern] [Show details]
```

### Privacy Controls

**/intelligence** - Manage intelligence settings
- Toggle extraction layers on/off
- Set confidence thresholds
- Clear learned patterns
- Export all intelligence data
- Delete all enrichments

## LLM Integration

### Model Selection
- Primary: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (via Supabase Edge Functions)
- Fallback: Pattern-based extraction (built into Edge Function)
- Constraints: Single API call per entry via serverless function

### Architecture: Supabase Edge Functions Approach

**Why Edge Functions:**
1. **Security**: API keys stored server-side, never exposed to client
2. **Cost Control**: Central API key management, usage monitoring
3. **Performance**: Edge locations for low latency
4. **Reliability**: Built-in fallback when API fails
5. **Scalability**: Serverless auto-scaling

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// /supabase/functions/enrich-entry/index.ts
- Deployed as Supabase Edge Function
- Handles Claude API calls securely
- Returns enrichment or fallback mock data
- Processes in <3s with timeout handling
```

**Client Integration:**
```dart
// Flutter app calls Edge Function
final response = await supabase.functions.invoke(
  'enrich-entry',
  body: {
    'entryText': entry.content,
    'entryId': entry.id,
    'userContext': userFacts, // User's context facts
  }
);
```

### Prompt Engineering

**Current Tier 1 Enrichment Prompt (Production)**
1. User context facts (if any) passed as system context
2. Constrained vocabularies for each field
3. Entry text for analysis
4. JSON schema enforcement
5. Critical instructions to prevent false extractions (especially people names)

**Edge Function Fallback Logic**
- If Claude API fails → return mock enrichment
- Mock uses keyword detection for basic accuracy
- Ensures zero downtime for enrichment pipeline

### Response Parsing
- Edge Function validates JSON response
- Transforms to Flutter-compatible format
- Falls back to mock on parse failure
- Returns success/failure status with enrichment

## Testing Strategy

### User Acceptance Criteria
- Tier 1 accuracy >85%
- Event extraction precision >90%
- VLP false positive rate <5%
- Pattern relevance >80%
- Processing time <3s for Tier 1, <5s total

## Rollout Plan

### ✅ Phase 1: Foundation (COMPLETED - 2025-10-21)
- ✅ Database schema setup (Supabase + SQLite)
- ✅ Basic enrichment pipeline (queue-based processing)
- ✅ Tier 1 extraction with REAL Claude API (emotion, themes, people, urgency)
- ✅ Visual indicators (⚡ processing → ✅ complete)
- ✅ Enrichment model with all fields from spec
- ✅ Service layer with background processing
- ✅ /context command implementation (add, list, remove, clear)
- ✅ Supabase Edge Functions for secure LLM integration
- ✅ Context persistence across sessions - FIXED

**What's Working:**
- Real-time AI enrichment using Claude 3.5 Sonnet via Edge Functions
- Accurate sentiment detection (contemplative, positive, energized, etc.)
- Smart topic categorization (family, health, work, relationships)
- Reliable people extraction (Mom, Dad, Samantha, Emma, Robert, Chen)
- Priority level assignment based on content
- /context commands persist data across sessions
- Enrichments display as colored tags on entries
- Processing completes in ~2-3 seconds
- Fallback to mock enrichment if API fails

**Live Features:**
- **Sentiment Tags**: Green (positive), Red (negative/anxious), Gray (neutral)
- **Topic Tags**: Blue/Indigo (work, family, health, relationships)
- **People Tags**: Orange/Amber (extracted names)
- **Priority Tags**: Red (high), Orange (medium), Gray (low)
- **/context Command**: Store facts about yourself that enhance AI analysis
  - `/context add I work at Google` - Add personal context
  - `/context list` - View all stored facts
  - `/context remove [id]` - Remove specific fact
  - `/context clear` - Clear all facts

**Fixed Issues:**
- ✅ Context persistence on refresh/restart (loads from Supabase on init)
- ✅ Supabase sync for enrichments and user facts
- ✅ Proper session restoration with context loading

### 🚧 Phase 2: Event Intelligence (90% Complete - 2025-10-21)

## Implementation Details (Flutter/Dart)

### Database Schema Created
```sql
-- Supabase enrichments table
CREATE TABLE enrichments (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    entry_id UUID REFERENCES entries(id),
    user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    emotion TEXT,
    themes TEXT[],
    people JSONB,

    processing_time_ms INTEGER,
    error_message TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Files Created/Modified
- `/lib/models/enrichment.dart` - Enrichment model with all fields
- `/lib/services/enrichment_service.dart` - Queue processing, mock enrichment
- `/lib/services/supabase_service.dart` - Added enrichment CRUD methods

**Themes:** work/meeting → work, exercise/gym → health, money/budget → finance
**Urgency:** urgent/asap → high, soon/today → medium
**People:** Capitalized names (John, Sarah, etc.)

## Next Small Steps

### ✅ Phase 1 Complete! AI Enrichment is Live

The intelligence system is now operational with:
- Real-time Claude AI enrichment
- Persistent user context (/context command)
- Accurate extraction of sentiment, topics, people, and priority
- Beautiful tag-based visualization
- Session persistence and restoration

### Next Critical Fixes

#### 🚨 Immediate Issues (Fix First)
1. **Debug /events null error**
   - Event.fromJson may have null handling issues
   - Check extraction_method and updated_at fields
   - Verify database data matches model expectations

2. **Fix time display "just now" bug**
   - All entries show "just now" instead of actual time
   - Likely relative time formatting issue
   - Check Entry.createdAt and display logic

#### 🔧 Major Improvement Needed
3. **Replace Regex with LLM-Based Event Extraction**
   - Current regex approach is brittle and frustrating
   - Move extraction to Supabase Edge Function
   - Use Claude to extract events with enrichments
   - Benefits:
     - No more regex pattern maintenance
     - Handles natural language variations
     - Better context understanding
     - Single API call for both enrichment + events

#### 📊 Session Stats (2025-10-21)
- Files created: 5 (SQL migration, Event model, EventExtractionService, test file, /events command)
- Lines of code: ~2000+
- Regex patterns written: 8 (and they're still not perfect!)
- Time spent on regex debugging: Too much! 😤
- Events successfully extracted: Yes, but with pain
- Developer satisfaction: Low (regex fatigue)

### 💡 Recommendation: Pivot to LLM-Based Extraction

**Current Pain Points with Regex:**
- "Cycled" not detected → had to add pattern
- "Biked" not detected → had to add pattern
- "Swam" not detected → had to add pattern
- Meeting confidence too low → had to tweak scoring
- Every new verb requires code changes
- Fragile and frustrating to maintain

**Proposed LLM Solution:**
1. Update Edge Function to extract events
2. Claude understands all variations naturally
3. One API call for enrichment + events
4. No more client-side regex maintenance
5. Better accuracy and context understanding

**Implementation Effort:**
- 1 hour to update Edge Function
- 30 min to update client to receive events
- Delete 500+ lines of regex code! 🎉

### Phase 3: Pattern Recognition (Week 3-4)
1. **Temporal Patterns**
   - Analyze entry timing (morning/afternoon/evening)
   - Track emotion/theme patterns by time
   - Identify peak productivity periods

2. **Person Relationships**
   - Track sentiment when people are mentioned
   - Infer relationship types from context
   - Build interaction frequency heatmaps

3. **Causal Chains**
   - Detect A→B patterns (stress→coping, activity→mood)
   - Require 3+ occurrences for pattern confirmation
   - Surface insights to user
