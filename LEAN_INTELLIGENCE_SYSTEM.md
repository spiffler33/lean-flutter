# LEAN INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM - Implementation Specification

## Executive Summary

Build a privacy-first, local intelligence layer for Lean that extracts structured insights from unstructured thoughts. The system learns user patterns without requiring configuration, extracts trackable events conservatively, and surfaces meaningful connections between thoughts, people, and behaviors.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

**Entry Pipeline**
- User types entry → Save to DB instantly (<100ms)
- Trigger async enrichment pipeline
- Display enrichment status (⚡ processing → ✓ complete)
- Store raw entry + enrichments separately

**Intelligence Layers**
1. **Tier 1 (Universal)** - Applied to 100% of entries
2. **Tier 2 (Event)** - Applied when confidence ≥0.85
3. **Tier 3 (Patterns)** - Computed from accumulated data
4. **Tier 4 (Insights)** - Higher-order connections

**Storage Strategy**
- Raw entries: Immutable source of truth
- Enrichments: JSONB fields, versioned
- Patterns: Materialized views, refreshed hourly
- Events: Separate table with entry linkage

## Intelligence Pipeline

### Stage 1: Entry Processing (Synchronous)
1. Save raw entry
2. Return success immediately
3. Queue enrichment job

### Stage 2: Tier 1 Enrichment (Async, <3s)

**Emotion Detection**
- Vocabulary: frustrated, anxious, excited, content, calm, energized, tired, sad, angry, overwhelmed, focused, grateful, contemplative, curious, scattered, accomplished, lonely, bored, neutral
- Method: LLM with fallback to keyword patterns
- Constraints: Single emotion per entry

**Theme Classification**
- Vocabulary: work, personal, health, relationships, finance, creative, tech, learning, leisure, reflection
- Method: LLM with fallback to keyword matching
- Constraints: Maximum 3 themes, ordered by relevance

**People Extraction**
- Method: NER + capitalization patterns + user context
- Enhancement: Track sentiment about person in this entry
- Store: Name + sentiment + context of mention

**Urgency Detection**
- Levels: low, medium, high
- Signals: Time markers, action words, emotional intensity
- Method: Rule-based + LLM validation

**Action Extraction**
- Patterns: "need to", "must", "todo:", "should", "have to"
- Method: Regex + LLM validation
- Output: Array of actionable items

**Question Detection**
- Types: open-ended, yes/no, rhetorical
- Method: Punctuation + sentence structure + LLM
- Track: Question lifecycle (open → answered)

### Stage 3: Tier 2 Event Extraction (Async, <5s)

**Confidence Calculation**
- Base signals:
  - Numbers + units: +0.50
  - Numbers + domain words: +0.35
  - Perfective past tense: +0.25
  - Time duration: +0.25
  - VLP match: +0.30
  - Main clause position: +0.15
- Negative signals:
  - Intent modals (should/planning): -0.50
  - Background subordinators: -0.35
  - Hedges (maybe/might): -0.20

**Extraction Thresholds**
- Extract: confidence ≥ 0.85
- Shadow (learn but don't save): 0.65-0.85
- Ignore: <0.65

**Event Types**
- exercise (subtypes: squat, run, walk, yoga, swim, bike, weights)
- consumption (subtypes: alcohol, caffeine, food, supplements)
- spend (subtypes: groceries, transport, entertainment, bills)
- sleep (metrics: duration, quality)
- meeting (subtypes: 1:1, team, client, interview)
- health (subtypes: symptom, medication, appointment)

### Stage 4: Pattern Detection (Batch, hourly)

**VLP Promotion**
- Trigger: Phrase used 3+ times in 28 days
- Validation: Check for consistency in context
- Auto-promote: If confidence >0.90
- User-promote: Present in UI for confirmation

**Person Relationships**
- Analyze co-occurrence with themes/contexts
- Infer relationship type from interaction patterns
- Calculate average sentiment
- Track interaction frequency

**Temporal Patterns**
- Segment by: hour blocks, day of week
- Calculate: dominant emotions, themes, entry frequency
- Identify: Peak productivity, stress times, reflection periods

**Causal Chains**
- Window: Look for patterns within time windows
- Correlation: Track A→B occurrences
- Threshold: Minimum 3 occurrences for pattern
- Types: stress→coping, activity→mood, trigger→behavior

### Stage 5: Insight Generation (Batch, daily)

**Cross-Pattern Analysis**
- People + emotion correlations
- Time + theme patterns
- Event + outcome chains
- Question → answer paths

**Anomaly Detection**
- Unusual emotion for time period
- Break in established patterns
- New people/contexts appearing
- Urgency spikes

## User Experience

### Entry Flow
1. User types entry
2. Instant save (<100ms)
3. Lightning icon appears (enriching)
4. Check mark appears (2s, then fades)
5. Enrichments silently added to entry

```

**For Causal Patterns**
```

- Delete all enrichments

## LLM Integration

### Model Selection
- Primary: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (via Supabase Edge Functions)
- Fallback: Pattern-based extraction (built into Edge Function)
- Constraints: Single API call per entry via serverless function

### Architecture: Supabase Edge Functions Approach

**Why Edge Functions:**
1. **Security**: API keys stored server-side, never exposed to client
2. **Cost Control**: Central API key management, usage monitoring
3. **Performance**: Edge locations for low latency
4. **Reliability**: Built-in fallback when API fails
5. **Scalability**: Serverless auto-scaling

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// /supabase/functions/enrich-entry/index.ts
- Deployed as Supabase Edge Function
- Handles Claude API calls securely
- Returns enrichment or fallback mock data
- Processes in <3s with timeout handling
```

**Client Integration:**
```dart
// Flutter app calls Edge Function
final response = await supabase.functions.invoke(
  'enrich-entry',
  body: {
    'entryText': entry.content,
    'entryId': entry.id,
    'userContext': userFacts, // User's context facts
  }
);
```

### Prompt Engineering

**Current Tier 1 Enrichment Prompt (Production)**
1. User context facts (if any) passed as system context
2. Constrained vocabularies for each field
3. Entry text for analysis
4. JSON schema enforcement
5. Critical instructions to prevent false extractions (especially people names)

**Edge Function Fallback Logic**
- If Claude API fails → return mock enrichment
- Mock uses keyword detection for basic accuracy
- Ensures zero downtime for enrichment pipeline

### Response Parsing
- Edge Function validates JSON response
- Transforms to Flutter-compatible format
- Falls back to mock on parse failure
- Returns success/failure status with enrichment

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Emotion detection accuracy
- Theme classification precision
- Event extraction confidence calculation
- VLP promotion logic

### User Acceptance Criteria
- Tier 1 accuracy >85%
- Event extraction precision >90%
- VLP false positive rate <5%
- Pattern relevance >80%
- Processing time <3s for Tier 1, <5s total

## Rollout Plan

### ✅ Phase 1: Foundation (COMPLETED - 2025-10-20)
- ✅ Database schema setup (Supabase + SQLite)
- ✅ Basic enrichment pipeline (queue-based processing)

- ✅ Visual indicators (⚡ processing → ✅ complete)
- ✅ Enrichment model with all fields from spec
- ✅ Service layer with background processing
- ✅ /context command implementation (add, list, remove, clear)
- ✅ Supabase Edge Functions for secure LLM integration

**What's Working:**
