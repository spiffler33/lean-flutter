# Context-Aware People Extraction - Fix Summary

## Problem
Entry "call captivate for nandini party" failed to extract "Nandini" as a person, even though user context states "my daughter's name is Nandini". The issue was case-sensitivity: "nandini" (lowercase) wasn't recognized.

## Root Causes
1. **LLM prompt was too strict**: Only extracted names that "actually appear in the text" without considering context
2. **Fallback function didn't check context**: Only detected capitalized words like "Nandini", missed lowercase "nandini"
3. **Case-sensitive matching**: System didn't normalize case for known people from context

## Fixes Implemented

### Fix 1: Enhanced Fallback Function
**File**: `main.py:701-744`

```python
def extract_people_fallback(text: str, user_context: str = "") -> List[str]:
    """
    Fallback people extraction using regex + context matching.
    Now checks user context for known people names (case-insensitive).
    """
    # Extract known people from context using regex patterns
    context_people = []
    if user_context:
        name_patterns = [
            r"(?:daughter|son|wife|husband|partner|boss|manager|colleague|friend)(?:'s)?\s+(?:name\s+)?is\s+(\w+)",
            r"(\w+)\s+is\s+my\s+(?:daughter|son|wife|husband|partner|boss|manager|colleague|friend)",
        ]
        for pattern in name_patterns:
            matches = re.findall(pattern, user_context.lower())
            context_people.extend([m.capitalize() for m in matches if len(m) > 1])

    # Check each word in text against context people (case-insensitive)
    text_lower = text.lower()
    for context_person in context_people:
        if context_person.lower() in text_lower:
            if context_person not in people:
                people.append(context_person)
```

**What it does:**
- Extracts known people from user context using relationship patterns
- Matches against entry text case-insensitively
- Returns properly capitalized names from context

### Fix 2: Improved LLM Prompt
**File**: `main.py:746-781`

```python
async def extract_people(text: str, user_context: str = "") -> List[str]:
    """Extract mentioned people's names using LLM with fallback."""
    prompt = f"""{context_prefix}Extract people's names MENTIONED in this text. Consider known names from context even if lowercase.

IMPORTANT:
- Extract names that appear in the text, even if they're lowercase
- Use the user context to recognize known people (e.g., if context says "my daughter is Nandini", then "nandini" in text refers to that person)
- Return the properly capitalized version from context when available

Text: "{text}"

Return ONLY a JSON array of names like: ["Sarah", "John", "Nandini"]. If no names in text, return []"""
```

**What it does:**
- Explicitly tells LLM to consider lowercase names
- Instructs LLM to use context for recognition
- Asks for properly capitalized output

### Fix 3: Context Passing
**File**: `main.py:888` (in `process_entry_with_llm`)

```python
# Extract people with full context (includes user facts)
people = await extract_people(content, full_context)

# Fallback also receives context
return extract_people_fallback(text, user_context)  # Line 781
```

## Test Results

### Unit Test (Fallback Function)
```bash
Test text: call captivate for nandini party
Extracted people: ['Nandini']

✓ SUCCESS: Nandini was correctly extracted (case-insensitive match worked!)
```

### Integration Test (Full Pipeline)
```bash
Test text: call captivate for nandini party
Extracted people (via LLM/fallback): ['Nandini']

✓ SUCCESS: Full extraction pipeline working!
```

## How It Works Now

1. **User creates entry**: "call captivate for nandini party"
2. **System builds context**: Includes "my daughter's name is Nandini"
3. **LLM tries extraction**: May timeout (as before)
4. **Fallback activates**:
   - Extracts "Nandini" from context patterns
   - Searches for "nandini" (lowercase) in entry text
   - Finds match, returns "Nandini" (properly capitalized)
5. **Entry saved with**: `people: ["Nandini"]`
6. **Pattern tracking updates**: Nandini's correlations updated

## User Context Facts Detected
From `lean.db`:
- "my daughter's name is Nandini" → Matches pattern 1
- "my son's name is Ved" → Matches pattern 1
- "my boss is Kerem at Deutsche Bank" → Matches pattern 2

## Benefits

1. **Case-insensitive matching**: "nandini", "Nandini", "NANDINI" all work
2. **Context-aware**: Recognizes known people even without capitalization
3. **Robust fallback**: Works even when LLM times out
4. **Proper capitalization**: Always returns names capitalized from context
5. **Relationship-aware**: Understands daughter/son/boss/colleague patterns

## Next Steps

**Ready for testing!** Try these entries:
- "call captivate for nandini party" → Should extract Nandini
- "ved has soccer practice" → Should extract Ved
- "meeting with kerem tomorrow" → Should extract Kerem
- "dinner with nandini and ved" → Should extract both

All extractions should work case-insensitively and return properly capitalized names!
