# Stage 2: Database Schema Extension - Implementation Complete ✅

## Summary
Implemented pure infrastructure changes to prepare for multi-extractor functionality. Added new database columns for richer extraction without changing any visible functionality.

## Changes Made (26 lines total - well under 75 line constraint)

### 1. Database Migration (main.py:64-78) - 15 lines
Added four new columns to entries table:
- `emotion` TEXT - Stores specific emotion words (migrated from mood)
- `themes` TEXT - JSON array for conceptual themes (default: '[]')
- `people` TEXT - JSON array for mentioned people/entities (default: '[]')
- `urgency` TEXT - Time sensitivity level (default: 'none')

**Migration Strategy:**
```python
if 'emotion' not in columns:
    c.execute("ALTER TABLE entries ADD COLUMN emotion TEXT")
    # Migrate existing mood data to emotion column
    c.execute("UPDATE entries SET emotion = mood WHERE mood IS NOT NULL")
    print("Migrated existing mood data to emotion column")
```

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Non-destructive: Keeps `mood` column for backwards compatibility
- ✅ Safe: Checks for column existence before adding
- ✅ Data preservation: Copies all existing mood values to emotion column
- ✅ Graceful defaults: New entries get sensible defaults automatically

### 2. Entry Processing Update (main.py:346-364) - 11 lines
Updated `process_entry_with_llm` to populate new columns:
```python
c.execute(
    """UPDATE entries SET tags = ?, mood = ?, emotion = ?, actions = ?,
       themes = ?, people = ?, urgency = ? WHERE id = ?""",
    (json.dumps(result["tags"]), result["mood"], result["mood"],
     json.dumps(result["actions"]), '[]', '[]', 'none', entry_id)
)
```

**Current Behavior:**
- Emotion: Copied from mood field (Stage 1 emotion detection)
- Themes: Empty array (awaiting Stage 3 theme extractor)
- People: Empty array (awaiting Stage 3 people extractor)
- Urgency: Set to 'none' (awaiting Stage 3 urgency detector)

### 3. Database Schema
**Before Stage 2:**
```
id, content, created_at, tags, mood, actions
```

**After Stage 2:**
```
id, content, created_at, tags, mood, emotion, actions, themes, people, urgency
```

## Verification

### Migration Success
From server logs:
```
Migrated existing mood data to emotion column
```

### Data Integrity
- ✅ All existing entries preserved
- ✅ Existing mood values copied to emotion column
- ✅ New entries get both mood and emotion populated
- ✅ No display errors or broken functionality

### Backwards Compatibility
- ✅ Old code still uses 'mood' column - no breaking changes
- ✅ Display continues to show mood indicators
- ✅ All LEAN_TESTS.md tests pass (no functional changes)
- ✅ Entry creation, editing, deletion all working

### Sample Entry Processing
From logs showing successful processing with new fields:
```
LLM processed entry 167: actions=[], tags=[], emotion=angry
LLM processed entry 168: actions=[], tags=[], emotion=excited
LLM processed entry 170: actions=[], tags=[], emotion=melancholic
```

## Technical Details

### Column Types & Defaults
| Column   | Type | Default | Purpose                          |
|----------|------|---------|----------------------------------|
| emotion  | TEXT | NULL    | Specific emotion word            |
| themes   | TEXT | '[]'    | JSON array of conceptual themes  |
| people   | TEXT | '[]'    | JSON array of people/entities    |
| urgency  | TEXT | 'none'  | Time sensitivity (low/med/high)  |

### Migration Characteristics
- **Idempotent**: Can run multiple times safely (checks column existence)
- **Reversible**: Can drop new columns without data loss (mood still exists)
- **Zero downtime**: Migration runs instantly on startup
- **Data safe**: Uses WHERE clause to only migrate non-NULL values

## What Stage 2 Did NOT Do (By Design)
- ❌ No display changes (indicators still show mood)
- ❌ No extraction logic changes (still using Stage 1 emotion detection)
- ❌ No theme/people/urgency extraction (awaiting Stage 3)
- ❌ No UI updates (that's Stage 4 with auto-reveal)

## Next Steps for Stage 3
Stage 2 prepared the database. Stage 3 will implement:
1. Theme extractor (work, personal, health, finance, etc.)
2. People/entity extractor (capitalized names)
3. Urgency detector (deadline keywords)
4. Parallel extraction pattern (asyncio for speed)

The infrastructure is now ready for multi-extractor functionality!

## Files Modified
- `main.py:64-78` - Database migration in init_db()
- `main.py:346-364` - Entry processing update

**Total: 26 lines changed (65% under budget)**

## Constraints Met
- ✅ Maximum 75 lines of changes (actual: 26)
- ✅ No display changes (pure infrastructure)
- ✅ Schema and model updates only
- ✅ Handles existing data gracefully
- ✅ Backwards compatible
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ Safe and reversible migration
