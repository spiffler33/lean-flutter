# Stage 4: Enhanced Temporal Pattern Intelligence - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

## Summary

Successfully implemented Stage 4 of LEAN_CONTEXT_EVOLUTION.md, enhancing Lean's ability to understand WHEN you write and HOW your writing differs by time.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced Temporal Pattern Tracking (main.py:393-466)

**Before:**
- Basic time_block + weekday tracking
- Simple confidence calculation
- Single pattern per observation

**After (Stage 4):**
- **3-tier pattern tracking:**
  1. Specific: `(time_block, weekday)` - e.g., "Monday morning"
  2. Time-only: `(time_block, 'all')` - e.g., "morning"
  3. Day-type: `('all', weekday_type)` - e.g., "weekday" or "weekend"
- **Enhanced confidence scoring:**
  - 5-10 samples: 40% confidence
  - 10-20 samples: 60% confidence
  - 20-50 samples: 80% confidence
  - 50+ samples: 90% confidence
- Each entry updates all 3 pattern types simultaneously

**Lines added:** ~15 lines (net)

### 2. Improved Temporal Context Selection (main.py:236-297)

**Before:**
- Single pattern match: specific day + time
- No fallback logic
- Minimal context description

**After (Stage 4):**
- **Smart 3-tier fallback:**
  1. Try specific match first (e.g., "Monday morning")
  2. Fallback to time-only (e.g., "mornings")
  3. Fallback to day-type (e.g., "weekdays")
- **Richer context formatting:**
  - "Monday mornings: usually work (anxious) [15 times]"
  - "Evenings: often personal, leisure (grateful, tired)"
  - "Weekdays: typically work, relationships (focused, neutral)"

**Lines added:** ~39 lines (net)

### 3. Enhanced /patterns Display (main.py:1095-1156)

**Before:**
- Simple list of temporal patterns
- No grouping or organization
- Generic emoji usage

**After (Stage 4):**
- **Organized sections:**
  - ‚è∞ BY TIME OF DAY - Shows morning/afternoon/evening/night patterns
  - üìÜ BY DAY OF WEEK - Shows specific day+time combinations
  - üîÑ WEEKDAY VS WEEKEND - Shows day-type patterns
- **Sorted intelligently:**
  - Time patterns by time of day
  - Day patterns by day order (Mon-Sun)
- **Richer descriptions:**
  - Shows themes and emotions together
  - Includes sample counts for confidence
  - Only displays high-quality patterns (70%+ confidence)

**Lines added:** ~48 lines (net)

## Test Results

### Unit Tests (test_stage4_temporal.py)
‚úÖ **Temporal pattern tracking** - Correctly tracks all 3 pattern types
‚úÖ **Context selection** - Smart fallback logic works correctly
‚úÖ **Confidence scoring** - Scales appropriately with sample size
‚úÖ **Pattern display** - Shows enhanced temporal insights

### Integration Tests (test_stage4_integration.py)
‚úÖ **Real entry creation** - Entries tracked correctly
‚úÖ **Background processing** - LLM extraction integrates with patterns
‚úÖ **Pattern display** - Shows meaningful time-based insights
‚úÖ **All sections present** - Time-of-day, day-of-week, weekday/weekend

## Example Output

### Before Stage 4:
```
Time Patterns:
‚Ä¢ nights: work, personal [neutral, positive] (84 samples)
```

### After Stage 4:
```
üìÖ YOUR WRITING RHYTHMS

‚è∞ BY TIME OF DAY
‚Ä¢ ‚òÄÔ∏è Mornings (50 entries)
  work ‚Äî focused

üìÜ BY DAY OF WEEK
‚Ä¢ Monday mornings (15 entries)
  work ‚Äî anxious
‚Ä¢ Friday evenings (12 entries)
  personal ‚Äî grateful

üîÑ WEEKDAY VS WEEKEND
‚Ä¢ Weekdays (57 entries)
  work, relationships ‚Äî focused, neutral
‚Ä¢ Weekends (22 entries)
  leisure, personal ‚Äî content, relaxed
```

## Performance Impact

- **Entry creation:** Still <100ms (no degradation)
- **Pattern updates:** Asynchronous, non-blocking
- **Context selection:** Efficient 3-tier SQL query with fallbacks
- **Database size:** Minimal growth (3 patterns per entry vs 1)

## Code Metrics

- **Total Stage 4 additions:** ~102 lines (net)
- **Files modified:** 1 (main.py)
- **Test files created:** 2
- **Current main.py size:** 1,873 lines
- **Line budget used:** 102 lines (exceeded 50-line target, but well-structured)

## What Lean Now Knows

After Stage 4, Lean understands:

1. **Time-of-day patterns** - When you write (mornings vs evenings)
2. **Day-of-week patterns** - Which days you write about what
3. **Day-type patterns** - Weekday vs weekend differences
4. **Temporal themes** - Work themes on Monday mornings, personal on weekend evenings
5. **Temporal emotions** - Anxious on Monday mornings, grateful on Friday evenings
6. **Confidence levels** - How certain Lean is about each pattern

## Next Steps (Stage 5)

Stage 4 complete! Ready for Stage 5:
- Confidence scoring refinement
- Context decay (patterns fade over time)
- Insight generation (comparative patterns)
- Pattern quality metrics

## Files Changed

- `main.py` - Enhanced 3 functions for Stage 4
- `test_stage4_temporal.py` - Comprehensive unit tests
- `test_stage4_integration.py` - Real-world integration test
- `STAGE4_COMPLETE.md` - This summary document

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Run unit tests
python test_stage4_temporal.py

# Run integration test (requires server running)
python test_stage4_integration.py

# Check patterns display
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/entries -d "content=/patterns"

# Create test entry and verify temporal tracking
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/entries -d "content=Monday morning work meeting #work"
```
