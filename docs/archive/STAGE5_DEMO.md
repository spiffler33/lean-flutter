# Stage 5 Demo: Intelligence & Polish

## Quick Demo of New Features

### 1. Context Decay in Action

**How it works:**
- Recent patterns (last 7 days) = 100% weight
- 8-30 day old patterns = 80% weight
- 31-90 day old patterns = 60% weight
- 90+ day old patterns = 40% weight

**What this means:**
Your recent behavior matters more than old patterns. If you used to mention "work" anxiously 3 months ago, but now mention it neutrally, Lean will prioritize the recent pattern.

**Try it:**
1. Check `/patterns` to see current patterns
2. Create entries with different emotional contexts
3. Wait a few days, check `/patterns` again
4. Notice how recent entries influence the patterns more

### 2. Intelligent Insights

**What Lean now tells you:**

**Frequency Insights:**
```
üí° INSIGHTS (last 30 days)

‚Ä¢ You write 7.7x more on weekdays (176 entries vs 23 weekend)
```

**Emotional Insights:**
```
‚Ä¢ Mondays are usually neutral (38/51 entries)
```

**Relationship Insights:**
```
‚Ä¢ When you mention Sarah, you're usually focused (85%)
```

**Try it:**
1. Type `/patterns`
2. Scroll to the bottom
3. See the üí° INSIGHTS section
4. These are automatically generated from your last 30 days

### 3. Voice-Ready Context

**Now accepts natural language facts:**

```bash
/context I work at Deutsche Bank
/context Work at Google  # Normalizes to full sentence
/context Sarah is my manager
/context My team is in Singapore
```

All of these are now properly categorized and stored!

**Future preparation:**
- Intent classification (thought vs context vs command)
- Natural language normalization
- Relationship extraction

### 4. Enhanced /patterns Command

**Before Stage 5:**
```
=== What Lean Has Learned About You ===

üë§ PEOPLE YOU MENTION OFTEN
‚Ä¢ Sarah (15 times)

üìÖ YOUR WRITING RHYTHMS
‚Ä¢ Mornings (50 entries)
```

**After Stage 5:**
```
=== What Lean Has Learned About You ===

üë§ PEOPLE YOU MENTION OFTEN
‚Ä¢ Sarah (15 times)
  Usually work-related (12/15 entries)
  Often when you're feeling focused

üìÖ YOUR WRITING RHYTHMS

BY TIME OF DAY
‚Ä¢ Mornings (50 entries)
  work ‚Äî focused

BY DAY OF WEEK
‚Ä¢ Tuesday mornings (50 entries)
  work ‚Äî focused

WEEKDAY VS WEEKEND
‚Ä¢ Weekdays (183 entries)
  work, relationships ‚Äî focused, neutral

üí° INSIGHTS (last 30 days)

‚Ä¢ You write 8.0x more on weekdays
‚Ä¢ Mondays are usually neutral
‚Ä¢ When you mention Sarah, you're usually focused

üïí Patterns weighted by recency - recent behavior matters more
```

**Notice:**
- ‚úÖ Insights section added
- ‚úÖ Context decay note
- ‚úÖ More detailed pattern descriptions
- ‚úÖ Person-context correlations

## How Stage 5 Makes Lean Smarter

### Example Scenario: Pattern Evolution

**Week 1 (New Project):**
```
"Started new project with Sarah #work"
"Meeting with Sarah went well #work"
"Sarah gave me feedback on the design"
```

**Lean learns:**
- Sarah = work context (100%)
- Sarah = focused emotion (67%)

**Week 4 (Project Mature):**
```
"Sarah and I grabbed coffee #personal"
"Weekend plans with Sarah and the team"
"Sarah's birthday celebration"
```

**Lean adapts:**
- Sarah = mixed context (work 60%, personal 40%)
- Sarah = mix of focused/grateful
- Recent patterns weighted higher

**Stage 5 insight:**
```
‚Ä¢ When you mention Sarah, context varies:
  - 4 weeks ago: mostly work
  - Recently: mix of work and personal
```

### Example: Time Decay Impact

**Scenario:** You used to be anxious on Mondays, but therapy helped

**3 months ago (old pattern, 40% weight):**
- Monday patterns: anxious (10/10 entries)
- Pattern confidence: 0.9 * 0.4 = 0.36 (below 0.5 threshold)
- **Result:** Pattern filtered out ‚ùå

**Last 2 weeks (recent pattern, 100% weight):**
- Monday patterns: calm (8/8 entries)
- Pattern confidence: 0.8 * 1.0 = 0.8 (above 0.5 threshold)
- **Result:** Pattern shows up ‚úÖ

**What /patterns shows:**
```
BY DAY OF WEEK
‚Ä¢ Monday mornings (8 recent entries)
  personal, work ‚Äî calm, focused

üïí Patterns weighted by recency - recent behavior matters more
```

**Old anxiety pattern doesn't appear** because it's aged out!

## Testing the Features Yourself

### Test 1: See Your Insights
```bash
# Open Lean
# Type: /patterns
# Scroll to bottom
# Look for: üí° INSIGHTS (last 30 days)
```

**What you'll see:**
- Writing frequency patterns
- Emotional patterns by day
- Person-emotion correlations

**Requirements:**
- Need 20+ entries in last 30 days
- Insights require 70%+ confidence

### Test 2: Context Decay
```bash
# Check entity patterns
/patterns

# Find an entity (e.g., "Sarah")
# Note: "last seen X days ago"
# Note: Current confidence score

# Create new entry mentioning that entity
"Met with Sarah today #work"

# Check /patterns again
# Note: "last seen" updated to today
# Confidence refreshed to 100% weight
```

### Test 3: Voice-Ready Context
```bash
# Try these natural language facts:
/context I work at Anthropic
/context My manager is Alex
/context Based in San Francisco
/context Sarah is my teammate

# Check context storage:
/context

# Should see proper categorization:
# Work: I work at Anthropic
# People: My manager is Alex, Sarah is my teammate
# Location: Based in San Francisco
```

### Test 4: Insight Generation
```bash
# Create varied entries over different days/times
# Monday morning: "Work meeting with team #work"
# Tuesday evening: "Relaxing at home #personal"
# Wednesday morning: "Feeling anxious about deadline"
# Friday afternoon: "Week wrap-up, feeling grateful"

# After 20+ entries, check insights:
/patterns

# Look for patterns like:
# ‚Ä¢ You write 3x more on weekdays
# ‚Ä¢ Monday mornings are usually focused (8/10 entries)
# ‚Ä¢ When you mention [name], you're usually [emotion]
```
