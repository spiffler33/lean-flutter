## Phase 1: LEAN Intelligence System Foundation ✅

Implemented mock AI enrichment system with queue-based processing

### Features Added:
- **Database Layer**: Enrichments table in Supabase + SQLite mirror
- **Models**: Full Enrichment model with emotions, themes, people, urgency
- **Processing**: Async queue-based enrichment (2-second intervals)
- **Visual Feedback**: ⚡ processing → ✅ complete status indicators
- **Mock AI**: Keyword-based enrichment for testing (1-2s processing)
- **UI Integration**: Enriched badges display on entries

### Files Created:
- `/lib/models/enrichment.dart` - Complete enrichment model
- `/lib/services/enrichment_service.dart` - Queue processing & mock AI
- `/supabase/migrations/001_create_enrichments_table.sql` - DB schema
- `LEAN_INTELLIGENCE_SYSTEM.md` - Updated spec with progress

### Files Modified:
- `database_service.dart` - Added enrichments table (v2 migration)
- `entry_provider.dart` - Auto-queue entries for enrichment
- `supabase_service.dart` - Added enrichment CRUD methods
- `entry_widget.dart` - Visual indicators & enriched badges display

### Mock Enrichment Detection:
- **Emotions**: happy→excited, sad→sad, stress→anxious
- **Themes**: work/meeting→work, gym→health, money→finance
- **Urgency**: urgent/asap→high, soon/today→medium
- **People**: Capitalized names (John, Sarah, etc.)

### Testing Results:
- ✅ Entries auto-enrich on save
- ✅ Visual indicators working
- ✅ Badges display enriched data
- ✅ Processing in ~1-2 seconds
- ⚠️ Supabase sync disabled (needs entry_id mapping fix)

### Next Steps:
1. Replace mock with real Claude/Gemini API
2. Fix Supabase enrichment sync
3. Add /patterns command
4. Implement confidence scoring

### Issues Fixed:
- Cleaned 88 phantom entries from old user account
- Fixed database user ID confusion
- Removed enrichment sync errors (temporarily disabled)
